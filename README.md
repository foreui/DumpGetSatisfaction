DumpGetSatisfaction
===================

Get Satisfaction announces that they will stop offering free plan since December 3rd, 2014. The "Professional" plan listed on their website is 1,200 USD per month, which is quite expensive. As a company, the price may be affordable, but who are willing to pay so much for just a forum? Well, I can hear they start to say it is not just a forum. Of course it has some value-added services and tools, but still many people won't buy it.

We decided not to continue using Get Satisfaction, so we contacted their customer service and wish they can export our data for us to be used in new system. We dare to do so because we saw they claimed that they offer one-time export when user leave (https://getsatisfaction.com/getsatisfaction/topics/need_to_export_all_topics_and_their_answers#reply_9904120). As a result, they refused our request and said this export service "is for our paying clients as it takes a good amount of time for our developers". So we are on our own now.
